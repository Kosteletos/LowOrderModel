# LowOrderModel
* Low-order model of an unsteady streamwise gust interaction with a flat plate 
* Based on classical aerodynamic results
* Circulatory force history from Wagner (see Principles of Helicopter Aerodynamics - G. Leishman)
* Non-circulatory forces from analytic treatment of added-mass
* An iterative solver is used to mitigate the effect of streamwise gusts (i.e. solving for the angle of attack that produces a given lift)
